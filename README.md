Data Cleaning Using Power Query – Excel
This project demonstrates a complete data preprocessing workflow carried out in Microsoft Excel using the Power Query Editor. The original dataset contained several common real-world data quality issues, which were systematically cleaned and transformed to produce a consistent, analysis-ready dataset.

🔧 Cleaning & Pre-Processing Tasks

Duplicate Removal-Identified and removed all exact duplicate rows.
Null Handling – Filled missing values in key numerical columns (such as Amount) using median imputation to maintain accuracy and avoid skew.
Date Standardization – Converted inconsistent date formats into one unified format.
Text Formatting – Cleaned text fields by removing extra spaces and applying proper capitalization for names and categories.
Data Type Conversion – Assigned correct data types (dates, numbers, text) to ensure reliable downstream analysis.

⚙️ Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (Power Query Editor)

M-Language (Power Query Formula Language)
