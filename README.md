# Data-preprocessing-using-Power-query
This project is a comprehensive data-cleaning workflow using Power Query in Excel. The repository includes both the raw (unprocessed) dataset and the cleaned (processed) version. Using Excel’s Power Query Editor, I carried out a complete preprocessing process that addresses several real-world data quality issues.

Data Cleaning Using Power Query – Excel


🔧 Cleaning & Pre-Processing Tasks

Duplicate Removal – Identified and removed all exact duplicate rows.
Null Handling – Filled missing values in key numerical columns (such as Amount) using median imputation to maintain accuracy and avoid skew.
Date Standardization – Converted inconsistent date formats into one unified format.
Text Formatting – Cleaned text fields by removing extra spaces and applying proper capitalization for names and categories.
Data Type Conversion – Assigned correct data types (dates, numbers, text) to ensure reliable downstream analysis.
